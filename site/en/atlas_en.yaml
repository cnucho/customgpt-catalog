    limitations:
    - With very small samples or many sparse cells, χ² assumptions may be weak (consider
      exact tests or collapsing).
    - If the percent base (row% vs column%) is unclear, interpretations can be misleading;
      table meta is required.
    - Multi-select (checkbox) tables are non-mutually-exclusive; avoid direct comparisons
      to single-select crosstabs.
    - By default, it does not pull external web evidence; it interprets only the provided
      tables/text.

    limitations:
    - If the input is ambiguous or lacks definitions, the model may introduce more
      (assumption) nodes and depend on user-provided clarifications
    - Rendering quality depends on the viewer (e.g., Typora/Markdown engines) and
      their Mermaid feature support
    - Designed to avoid asserting facts not present in the source, so out-of-context
      extrapolation is intentionally limited

    - Consultants/analytics owners who want consistent statistical reporting pipelines
    limitations:
    - Equivalence/non-inferiority conclusions are highly sensitive to the chosen margin
      Δ; unjustified margins can undermine interpretability.
    - Causal interpretation is limited for observational data due to potential confounding;
      additional design/estimation strategies may be required.
    - Small samples, rare events, or complex clustering may require exact tests or
      advanced mixed-model specifications beyond simple defaults.

      not triggered unless the user explicitly requests them.
    - Statistical reliability/validity testing (e.g., Cronbach’s alpha, factor analysis)
      requires real data and external analysis; this GPT mainly supports process and
      recommendations.
    - Theory/model suggestions prioritize user-provided sources; unsupported theories
      are treated only as general GPT knowledge.
    - Web-survey logic/quality-control suggestions may depend on what your survey
      platform can implement.

    - Without sufficient user inputs (data type/scale, goals, constraints, use context,
      ethics/quality), Phase C decisions cannot be fully grounded

    - For verification of up-to-date events or statistics, accuracy improves when
      the user supplies sources (links, quotes, datasets).
