one_line: "Reviews questionnaires for flow, clarity, cognitive burden, and sensitivity, and simulates natural free-text responses from multiple personas."

functions:
  - "Diagnose item-level issues: clarity, cognitive load, ambiguity, sensitivity, and leading/loaded wording"
  - "Simulate natural-language answers from diverse personas (age, background, attitudes, device mode)"
  - "Detect likely response-quality risks (fatigue, nonresponse, social desirability) and flow problems"
  - "Recommend rewrites and improvements to options/scales and section transitions"

target_users:
  - "Researchers and questionnaire designers (UX, marketing, social science)"
  - "Insights / data teams responsible for survey quality"
  - "Product and service planners running user research"

ideal_use_cases:
  - "Pre-launch questionnaire review (pretest / cognitive walkthrough)"
  - "Checking and reducing social-desirability pressure in sensitive items"
  - "Assessing fatigue and cognitive burden for mobile-first surveys"
  - "Spotting wording/interpretation risks for multilingual or multicultural audiences"

limitations:
  - "Outputs are simulated (not real respondent data); confirm with pilots and field validation."
  - "If context (audience/purpose/channel) is missing, recommendations may be more generic."

example_commands:
  - "Evaluate this questionnaire item by item (clarity/cognitive burden/sensitivity/leading wording) and simulate natural responses from 5 personas."
  - "Check whether this item triggers social desirability bias, then propose neutral alternative wording and a better response scale."

additional_features:
  - "Persona-based free-text simulation, including uncertainty, avoidance, and natural nonresponse"
