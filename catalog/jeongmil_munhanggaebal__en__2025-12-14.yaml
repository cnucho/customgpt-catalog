last_updated: "2025-12-14"

one_line: "A precision survey-item design GPT that supports construct mapping, content validity checks, cognitive interview simulation, and reliability prediction in one workflow"

functions:
  - "Derive measurement constructs and sub-dimensions (factors) from items"
  - "Audit content validity (double-barreled items, ambiguity, leading/biasing wording, inappropriate terms) and propose revisions"
  - "Simulate cognitive interviews (virtual respondents’ answers and rationales) to detect interpretation variance"
  - "Detect semantic redundancy across items and recommend merge/removal"
  - "Predict reliability (e.g., Cronbach’s alpha) via simulated data and flag problematic items"
  - "Deliver a structured final item set (item-construct-dimension mapping) with version comparisons"

target_users:
  - "Survey and social science researchers (academic/public/private)"
  - "HR/organizational diagnostics practitioners and consultants"
  - "UX researchers and data analysts designing quantitative surveys"
  - "Educational/assessment item developers"

ideal_use_cases:
  - "Review and refine existing survey items for validity, bias, and redundancy"
  - "Design new scale items aligned to a construct-dimension framework and organize an item bank"
  - "Pre-test wording via cognitive-interview-style simulation to anticipate misinterpretations or reactance"
  - "Estimate reliability risks (low alpha, inconsistent items) before running a pilot"
  - "Neutralize socially desirable or leading phrasing in Likert-style questionnaires (default 5-point)"

limitations:
  - "Reliability and response distributions are simulation-based estimates, not real survey results; empirical validation is required"
  - "If the target population profile (role, industry, culture, language nuance) is unclear, item fit may degrade"
  - "Sensitive domains (politics/discrimination/health, etc.) may require additional ethical/legal review beyond wording fixes"
  - "Detailed internal mechanisms (procedural diagrams, algorithms, hidden rules) are not provided"

example_commands:
  - "Start precision item generation. Map these 12 items to constructs/dimensions, flag content-validity issues, and propose revised versions."
  - "Start precision item generation. Target: office workers aged 20–39. Create an 8-item job stress scale and show a 5-person cognitive interview simulation with rationales."
  - "Start precision item generation. Identify redundant items, propose merges, and predict Cronbach’s alpha using a 100-respondent simulation."
  - "Start precision item generation. Neutralize leading/socially desirable wording and output a version-comparison table."

additional_features:
  - "Default scale: 5-point Likert (1=Strongly disagree ~ 5=Strongly agree)"
  - "Default cognitive interview: 5 virtual respondents"
  - "Default reliability prediction: 100 virtual respondents with item-level diagnostics"
  - "Version tracking (before/after) and item-construct-dimension mapping table"
