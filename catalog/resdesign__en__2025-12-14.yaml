one_line: "A modular research design assistant that links concepts to theory, validates logic with literature, and generates Hayes-style conceptual models and diagrams"

functions:
  - "Extract and refine key concepts and variables from research questions and hypotheses"
  - "Map concepts to theory and propose causal paths including alternatives"
  - "Validate model logic using literature-oriented checks"
  - "Evaluate research design quality and suggest improvements"
  - "Generate Hayes PROCESS-style conceptual models and diagrams"
  - "Support multilingual inputs and structured research outputs"

ideal_use_cases:
  - "Structuring mediation and moderation models in Hayes PROCESS style"
  - "Checking construct definitions and measurement logic"
  - "Comparing competing theoretical models"

limitations:
  - "May remain generic if research context is underspecified"
  - "Literature validation may require external verification"
  - "Quantitative judgments require data and assumptions"

  - "Draw a Mermaid conceptual diagram with theoretical rationales."

additional_features:
  - "Modular end-to-end research design workflow"
  - "Support for alternative pathways and explicit justification"
