version: "v1.0.0"
created_at: "2025-12-14"
last_updated: "2025-12-14"

one_line: "Starts with 2–3 candidate conceptual/theoretical models, iteratively updates fit through guided questions, and refines the final choice (single/modified/hybrid) into Mermaid + schema-based JSON outputs."

functions:
  - "Phase A: Present 2–3 candidate models with balanced pros/cons"
  - "Phase B: Adaptive inquiry across data, goals, constraints, use context, and ethics/quality to update fit scores"
  - "Phase C: Decide on single/modified/hybrid and generate one Mermaid block (Korean labels) plus final JSON aligned to the schema"
  - "Provide evidence using a source priority order (peer-reviewed → government reports → official statistics) and enforce source quality gates"
  - "Run an internal review loop (definitions → missing subdimensions → consistency → recency → actionable suggestions)"

  - "evidence-based"
  - "mermaid"
  - "json-schema"

target_users:
  - "Academic researchers designing conceptual/theoretical frameworks"
  - "Policy/public-sector analysts needing explainable frameworks"
  - "Business strategy/planning teams for problem structuring"
  - "Consultants/PMs formalizing requirements into models"

ideal_use_cases:
  - "Compare and shortlist theory models (e.g., TAM/TPB/UTAUT) for a study design"
  - "Structure a policy/strategy project using frameworks (e.g., SWOT/PESTEL/Logic Model)"
  - "Define components and subdimensions for mixed-method designs and detect omissions"
  - "Produce report-ready outputs as Mermaid diagrams and structured JSON"

limitations:
  - "Phase A restricts deep dives into a single model and discourages early selection"
  - "Analytical ‘methods’ (stats/ML) are generally excluded as candidate models; they may be mentioned only as validation tools when relevant"
  - "Without sufficient user inputs (data type/scale, goals, constraints, use context, ethics/quality), Phase C decisions cannot be fully grounded"
  - "Certain sources (e.g., Wikipedia, personal blogs, unverified media) are filtered out by policy"

example_commands:
  - "My study uses Likert-scale surveys and aims to explain behavioral intention. Give only 3 Phase A candidates."
  - "This is a policy evaluation with stakeholder interviews. Use Phase B questions to fill the axes."
  - "Based on what we discussed, enter Phase C and output a modified or hybrid model with Mermaid + JSON."
  - "Audit my component definitions using the review module and list concrete improvement suggestions."

additional_features:
  - "Built-in evidence priority policy and prohibited source filters"
  - "Final output conforms to the JSON schema (components/justification/mermaid_code/review_suggestions)"
  - "Automatic improvement suggestions via an internal review module"
