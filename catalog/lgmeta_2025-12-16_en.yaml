one_line: "A metadata GPT that auto-suggests multi-variable logical/relational validation rules (LGMeta) for survey and dataset QC."

functions:
  - "Auto-suggest LGMeta multi-variable validation rule drafts from survey JSON and qcmeta.json"
  - "Generate conditional_presence rules from required_if / skip_if logic"
  - "Propose part_whole candidates using variable name/label patterns (total/sum/male/female/etc.)"
  - "Suggest uniqueness rules for identifiers (phone numbers, IDs, business registration numbers, etc.)"
  - "Propose existence/repeated_consistency rules for household-person repeated structures (e.g., household_id)"
  - "Suggest range_relation/hierarchy_order candidates for date/age/amount and financial hierarchies"
  - "Output rules in LGMeta CSV/JSON schema (default enabled=false; uncertain rules flagged as TODO in comments)"

tags:

  - "qc"
  - "statistics"

target_users:
  - "Data quality (QC) practitioners"
  - "Survey/panel designers and analysts"
  - "ETL and data pipeline engineers"

ideal_use_cases:
  - "Convert survey routing logic (required_if/skip_if) into multi-variable validation rule drafts"
  - "Quickly derive sum/parts checks (e.g., male+female=total) and percentage-sum (100%) candidates"
  - "Draft anti-duplication rules for identifiers (phone/ID/business numbers)"
  - "Suggest existence and cross-check rules for household-person repeated data structures"
  - "Generate candidate rules for ordering/ranges (dates/ages/amounts) and hierarchy constraints (e.g., profit layers)"

limitations:
  - "All auto-generated rules are disabled by default (enabled=false) and must be reviewed by a human"
  - "Without clear semantics/codebooks (e.g., missing/special codes), suggestions may be over/under-inclusive"
  - "If key context (questionnaire/codebook/sampling design) is missing, some rules may remain TODO-only"

example_commands:
  - "Given my survey JSON and qcmeta.json, propose LGMeta rule drafts in the lgmeta_draft.csv structure."
  - "Convert required_if/skip_if into conditional_presence rules, and mark uncertain ones with TODO comments."
  - "Find variables labeled with 'male/female/total' patterns and propose part_whole candidate rules."
  - "With household_id and person_id, suggest existence and repeated_consistency rules."

additional_features:
  - "Structured taxonomy by rule_type/subtype (part-whole, conditional presence, range/order, hierarchy, ratio, contradiction patterns, repeated consistency, single-value, uniqueness, existence)"
  - "Conforms to the CSV/JSON schema (fields: rule_id, rule_name, rule_type, subtype, scope, condition, expression, variables, group_by, human_desc_ko, severity, enabled, comment)"
