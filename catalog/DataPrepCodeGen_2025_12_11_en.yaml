version: "v1.0.0"
created_at: "2025-12-11"
last_updated: "2025-12-11"
one_line: "A GPT specialized in generating SPSS and R (tidyverse) code for official statistics and survey data preparation."
functions:
  - "Generate SPSS data preparation syntax based on survey/statistical metadata and codebooks"
  - "Translate SPSS preparation syntax into equivalent R (tidyverse) data preparation code (excluding analytical code)"
  - "Create variable labels, value labels, missing value definitions, and display formats for official statistics datasets"
alias:
  - "dataprepcodegen"
  - "dataprep-gpt"
tags:
  - "policy"
  - "statistics"
  - "research-assistant"
target_users:
  - "Statisticians and data managers working with official statistics and survey microdata"
  - "Practitioners responsible for SPSS-based data cleaning and preparation"
  - "Analysts transitioning from SPSS to R who need parallel preparation scripts"
ideal_use_cases:
  - "Automating SPSS variable/value labeling and missing value declarations from questionnaires or metadata files"
  - "Refactoring legacy SPSS preparation scripts into cleaner, documented syntax"
  - "Producing parallel SPSS and R (tidyverse) preparation scripts for the same dataset to support migration"
limitations:
  - "Does not generate or interpret statistical analysis code (e.g., regression, hypothesis tests); it focuses strictly on data preparation."
  - "Does not perform file system operations, database connections, or OS-level commands."
example_commands:
  - "Use this survey metadata to generate SPSS VARIABLE LABELS, VALUE LABELS, and MISSING VALUES syntax."
  - "Convert this SPSS data preparation script into R tidyverse code, excluding any analytical procedures."
  - "Given these variable roles (id, weight, psu, strata), create a reusable SPSS preparation template."
  - "From this codebook, draft SPSS FORMATS and any necessary type conversion code for income, age, and date variables."
  - "Generate SPSS VARSTOCASES syntax to reshape these repeated-measures variables from wide to long, plus the equivalent R code."
additional_features:
  - "Interprets metadata schemas (variable roles, semantic types, groups) to draft type conversions, grouped sums/means, and index variables"
  - "Adds concise Korean comments to SPSS and R code to document each preparation step for official statistics workflows"
