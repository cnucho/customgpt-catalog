one_line: "An academic research navigator that discovers feasible, data-backed topics and guides you from scoping to testable research questions, datasets, and method design."

functions:
  - "Select/refine field and subfield scope (Field Mapper)"
  - "Scan emerging/hot topics and trends (Emerging Topic Scanner)"
  - "Evaluate feasibility by time/skills/data/method complexity (Feasibility Grid)"
  - "Check open dataset availability and data-source options (Dataset Availability Checker)"
  - "Extract gaps and ‘future work’ directions from reviews/meta-analyses (Gap Mapper)"
  - "Convert broad scoping into specific, testable research questions (Scoping-to-Question Converter)"
  - "Provide next-step routing guidance (datasets, literature search, research design, policy/legal, modeling)"

target_users:
  - "Undergraduate/graduate students (thesis, capstone, term projects)"
  - "Early-career researchers (topic pivoting, pilot ideas)"
  - "Practitioner-researchers (turning policy/industry problems into RQs)"
  - "Research planners/PMs (portfolio building and prioritization)"

ideal_use_cases:
  - "From a vague interest to 3–10 narrowed, empirically testable topic candidates"
  - "Compare candidates by dataset access, method difficulty, and timeline fit"
  - "Define contribution points by mapping gaps from reviews/meta-analyses"
  - "Produce a one-page summary: final RQ, hypotheses, variables, and data needs"
  - "Hand off structured context to DatasetFinder/LitSearch/ResearchDesigner/PolicyScope/ModelArchitect"

limitations:
  - "No direct access to paywalled databases or automatic full-text downloading"
  - "Ethics (IRB), copyright, and dataset license requirements must be verified by the user"
  - "Does not assume the existence of proprietary/internal datasets unless the user confirms access"
  - "For fast-moving topics, strengthening outputs with web-based verification is recommended when requested"

example_commands:
  - "My field is economics and I'm interested in platform labor. Propose 5 feasible empirical topics with feasibility scores for a 12-week timeline."
  - "I want to study learning analytics with open datasets. Suggest candidate datasets and draft research questions."
  - "For air pollution and depression, summarize ‘future work’ from recent reviews, map gaps, and compress into 3 RQ candidates."
  - "I prefer panel data / DiD. Narrow to topics with easy data access and propose a research design."

additional_features:
  - "Modular workflow: field → trends → feasibility → data → gaps → research questions"
  - "Routing options: DatasetFinderGPT / LitSearchGPT / ResearchDesignerGPT / PolicyScope / ModelArchitectGPT"
  - "On request, outputs a ResearchExchangeSchema (YAML) for clean cross-GPT handoff with preserved context"
