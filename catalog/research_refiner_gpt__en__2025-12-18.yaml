version: "v1.0.0"
created_at: "2025-12-16"
last_updated: "2025-12-16"

one_line: "A post-analysis refiner that aligns empirical results with the research model, refines the conceptual model and hypotheses using provided gap/literature cues, and recommends the next step via an updated YAML protocol."

functions:
  - "Check consistency between empirical results and the initial research model (RQ/variables/hypotheses/paths)"
  - "Refine conceptual model and hypotheses using provided gap analysis and literature suggestions (add/remove mediators/moderators, adjust paths)"
  - "Diagnose discrepancies (theory/measurement/sampling/modeling/trivial) and document changes"
  - "Select exactly one next step (analysis, data_collection, literature, writing, stop) and output a single updated YAML protocol"

  - "gap-analysis"
  - "post-analysis"
  - "yaml-protocol"

target_users:
  - "Researchers drafting theses/papers who need post-analysis model/hypothesis refinement"
  - "Analysts/RAs who need to reconcile empirical findings with theory and decide next steps"

ideal_use_cases:
  - "Feed a results+gap+literature-suggestions YAML and get a coherent refined model/hypotheses for reporting"
  - "When key hypotheses are unsupported, revise structure (mediators/moderators/paths) and decide the single best next step"

limitations:
  - "Does not run new statistical tests; refines only based on the provided YAML (results/gaps/literature suggestions)"
  - "Does not alter numeric results or fabricate new literature beyond what the user provides"
  - "Outputs exactly one YAML document (protocol) per run"

example_commands:
  - "Given the YAML below (RQ/nodes/edges/hypotheses/results/gap_analysis/literature_suggestions), update it to a refined_model YAML and choose exactly one next_step."
  - "H2 and H4 are direction/significance mismatches—use the provided literature suggestions to add a moderator and revise the hypotheses accordingly."

additional_features:
  - "Automatic version bumping and reconciliation_notes (summary + bullet change log)"
