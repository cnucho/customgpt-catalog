one_line: 'A rule-driven assistant for end-to-end regression workflows: data checks,
  preprocessing, model design, diagnostics, and structured interpretation.'
functions:
- Auto-check missingness, outliers, distributions, and coding issues and provide handling
  recommendations
- Apply variable-transformation rules (log, dummy coding, ordinal scoring) and suggest
  candidates
- Support regression model planning across OLS/logistic/Poisson/negative binomial/PLS,
  including hierarchical (block-wise) comparisons
- Provide assumption and diagnostics checklists (VIF multicollinearity, overdispersion,
  residual diagnostics, etc.)
- Generate interpretation write-ups using a 5-step structure centered on coefficients/OR/VIP
  and fit metrics (R²/Q²)
alias:

tags:
- statistics
- regression
- ols
- logistic
- pls
- diagnostics
- research-assistant
- policy
target_users:
- Social science & policy researchers
- Graduate students writing theses/papers
- Data analysts doing regression-heavy work
ideal_use_cases:
- Document a standardized preprocessing/diagnostics workflow for survey or observational
  regression analyses
- Run hierarchical regression by adding variable blocks and comparing ΔR² across steps
- Design moderated regression with interaction terms (e.g., platform/group moderators)
- Assess overdispersion in Poisson models and propose NB/ZIP/ZINB alternatives
- Conduct PLS regression with cross-validated component selection and VIP-focused
  interpretation
limitations:
- Recommendations are rule-based; final decisions must reflect the study context (measurement,
  sampling, causal assumptions)
- If raw data quality is poor (coding errors, sampling bias, low response reliability),
  interpretability and trustworthiness are limited
- Auto-formatting to specific journal/institution reporting templates may require
  additional templates
example_commands:
- 'Analyze the ANPOR dataset: fit a 3-step hierarchical OLS model predicting sustainable
  actions, and report missing/outliers/VIF/residual diagnostics.'
- My Poisson model has dispersion = 2.0. Determine overdispersion, refit using negative
  binomial, and write an interpretation paragraph.
- The dependent variable has skewness 2.8. Should I log-transform it? If yes, show
  how to back-translate effects to the original scale.
- Run PLS with k-fold CV to choose components, then summarize results focusing on
  variables with VIP ≥ 1.
additional_features:
- Missingness workflow with a 5% threshold plus Little’s MCAR test decision path
- 'Multicollinearity rules: recommend removal at VIF>5 and require removal at VIF>10'
- 'PLS workflow: mandatory standardization, CV-based component selection, and reporting
  VIP/Q²/RMSECV'
- A 5-step interpretation template (purpose→methods→results→implications→comparison
  to prior work)
