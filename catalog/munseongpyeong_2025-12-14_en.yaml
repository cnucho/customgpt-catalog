one_line: "A strict evidence-only GPT that evaluates policy, survey, research, and marketing reports using a 6-axis quality framework."

functions:
  - "Summarize overall report structure and analyze problem framing (policy/research framing)"
  - "Conduct 6-axis evaluation: completeness, validity (data and logic consistency), feasibility, story coherence, clarity/fitness of problem setting, and methodology quality"
  - "Perform in-depth methodology audits: AAPOR RR/CR/COOP/REF, sampling design, weighting (design → nonresponse → post-stratification), variance estimation (Taylor/BRR/JK), design effects (DEFF), replicate weights, missingness/imputation flags"
  - "Assess measurement quality: measurement equivalence, time-series and subgroup comparability, scale reliability, factor analysis, and measurement invariance checks"
  - "Review reproducibility: availability of data, codebooks, questionnaires, and analytical procedures"
  - "Audit visualizations for uncertainty communication (confidence intervals, error bars, DEFF disclosure)"
  - "Provide concrete improvements in a source → revision → rationale format"
  - "Generate Story Mode outputs: Narrative_Spine, Coherence_Score (P1–P5), Breakpoints, Bridge_Texts, Story_Map"
  - "Assign axis-level grades and an overall weighted grade with explicit evidence"

target_users:
  - "Policy and research report quality assurance owners"
  - "Survey research practitioners (design, fielding, analysis)"
  - "Authors and reviewers of public, private, or academic research reports"
  - "Editors, peer reviewers, and internal audit teams"

ideal_use_cases:
  - "Audit survey reports for response rates (AAPOR), sampling, weighting, variance estimation, and DEFF compliance"
  - "Identify logical gaps between results, interpretation, and recommendations and repair narrative flow"
  - "Detect risks in time-series or subgroup comparisons due to definition changes or measurement non-equivalence"
  - "Ensure uncertainty is properly communicated in tables and figures (CIs, error bars, DEFF)"
  - "Generate a final pre-submission quality evaluation and revision guide"

limitations:
  - "All judgments are strictly based on the provided source text and attachments (Strict Factual Mode)"
  - "No speculation or inference beyond the evidence (zero-inference rule)"
  - "Does not answer general user questions; only produces evaluation outputs"
  - "Will not invent, adjust, or retrofit numbers, definitions, or methods absent from the source"
  - "Marks items as 'insufficient evidence' when documentation is lacking"

example_commands:
  - "Evaluate the attached report using the 6-axis framework. Include a full methodology audit (AAPOR, weighting, variance estimation, DEFF, missingness/imputation, scale validity, reproducibility)."
  - "Run a representative-chapter review and include Story Mode outputs (Narrative_Spine, Breakpoints, Bridge_Texts)."
  - "Identify where the narrative breaks between tables and interpretations, list Breakpoints, and draft Bridge_Texts in the original tone."
  - "Check whether time-series indicators are comparable across years and propose 'not comparable' labeling and bridging/adjustment options in a source-to-revision format."

additional_features:
  - "Strict Factual Mode (evidence-only; strict numerical and terminology fidelity)"
  - "StoryFlow evaluation module (narrative spine, coherence scoring, breakpoints, bridge text generation)"
  - "Checklist-driven methodology audit engine (AAPOR, weighting, variance estimation, measurement equivalence, reproducibility, uncertainty visualization)"
