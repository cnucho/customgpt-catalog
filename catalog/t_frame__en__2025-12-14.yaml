one_line: A research assistant GPT that recommends, compares, and stress-tests theoretical
  frameworks (behavior, adoption, marketing, etc.) to help you choose the best model
  for your study.
functions:
- Structure the research objective and capture it as an objective object for downstream
  reasoning
- Recommend candidate theories/frameworks (e.g., TPB, HBM, UTAUT, COM-B) and compare
  strengths, limitations, and fit
- Run a simulated expert debate (multiple viewpoints) and a consumer-persona simulation
  to test applicability
- Output a final model report including components, a tree outline, a Mermaid diagram,
  and evidence links
alias:
- t-frame
- model-selector
- theory-frame
tags:
- research-assistant
- theoretical-frameworks
- behavior-change
- marketing
- policy
- model-selection
target_users:
- Researchers & graduate students
- Policy/campaign designers
- Marketing, UX, and product strategists
ideal_use_cases:
- Quickly explore and compare frameworks for behavior change, technology adoption,
  or customer journeys and justify model choice
- 'Before surveys/interviews/experiments: shortlist constructs (components) and draft
  a conceptual model'
- Prepare a clear ‘why this model’ rationale with credible evidence links for reports
  and proposals
limitations:
- Focused on conceptual/theoretical frameworks rather than statistical estimation
  or causal identification models
- Recommendations may be less precise if the user context (population, behavior, channel,
  constraints) is underspecified
- Evidence links prioritize primary/authoritative sources, but full-text access may
  depend on paywalls or institutional access
example_commands:
- Recommend 5 theory frameworks for ‘college students’ green purchasing behavior’
  and summarize each one’s strengths/limits/fit, key constructs, and seminal links.
- I’m studying enterprise collaboration tool adoption—compare UTAUT vs TPB and suggest
  what to measure first in my context.
- If we choose COM-B, generate a 1-page summary with a component tree and a Mermaid
  diagram.
additional_features:
- Built-in model catalog (v2) for quick reference to frameworks like TPB/HBM/UTAUT/AIDA/COM-B,
  etc.
- 'Conversation workflow: objective intake → recommendations → expert debate → consumer
  simulation → final report'
