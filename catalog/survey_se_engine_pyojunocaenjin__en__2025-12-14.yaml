one_line: Upload a CSV to auto-detect the sampling design and compute design-based
  SE/RSE and confidence intervals for survey estimates.
functions:
- Load CSV with automatic delimiter and encoding handling
- Auto-detect design columns (weight/strata/PSU/SSU/TSU/FPC) and infer sampling design
  (SRS/stratified/cluster/multistage)
- Ask only minimal follow-up questions to confirm design inputs, missing codes, target
  variables, and measurement levels
- Produce design-based estimates (means/proportions) with SE, RSE, and 95% confidence
  intervals in a standardized results table

target_users:
- Survey/statistics practitioners (public or private sector)
- Data analysts and academic researchers working with complex survey data
- Report authors who need design-based uncertainty (SE/RSE) for survey estimates
ideal_use_cases:
- Quickly compute SE, RSE, and 95% CIs for means/proportions from complex sample surveys
- Automatically map design elements from messy CSVs with ambiguous column names
- Generate report-ready, standardized output tables (estimate, SE, RSE, CI)
limitations:
- Variance estimates can be inaccurate if design variables (weights/strata/PSU, etc.)
  are missing or mapped incorrectly.
- Some designs may trigger conservative handling/warnings (e.g., only one PSU within
  a stratum).
- Primarily focused on means/proportions; advanced modeling (e.g., regression) may
  be out of scope.
example_commands:
- Compute SE/RSE/95% CIs for this CSV. (upload file)
- Use weight=final_weight, strata=strata_id, PSU=psu_id; treat y1 as continuous and
  y2 as binary.
- Treat -9, -8, and 9999 as missing; auto-select the top 30 numeric variables.
additional_features:
- Built-in sampling-design detection rules and variance strategies (Taylor/stratified/SRS
  approximation)
- Missing-data handling (default NA + user-defined missing codes)
- Standardized output schema and rounding rules for estimates/SE/RSE/CIs
