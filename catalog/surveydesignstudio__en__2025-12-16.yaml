one_line: "An end-to-end survey design GPT for research agencies: from concept board to questionnaire, indices, analysis plan, and proposal storyboard"

functions:
  - "Design a concept board (objective, problem definition, hypotheses, target persona)"
  - "Build a survey framework (variables, domains, model) and map variables to items"
  - "Draft a sampling plan (frame, selection/quota structure, sample-size rationale)"
  - "Produce questionnaires (Basic/Extended/Exploratory versions) and rewrite items to remove bias and improve clarity"
  - "Define indices/metrics and computation logic (scales, aggregation rules)"
  - "Create an analysis plan (descriptives → segmentation → modeling) and recommend reporting structure"
  - "Generate a proposal storyboard (template-based) and deliverable outline"

target_users:
  - "Market research agencies (quant/qual) planners and PMs"
  - "Brand/marketing/UX researchers"
  - "Public sector / policy research teams"

ideal_use_cases:
  - "Turn a topic or RFP into a structured survey plan (framework, sampling, questionnaire, analysis, reporting) as a strong first draft"
  - "Rewrite existing questions to be clearer and more neutral (remove leading, double-barreled, or vague wording)"
  - "Design index systems (e.g., satisfaction/loyalty/experience) with dimensions and scoring rules plus the item set"
  - "Structure proposal storylines and slide outlines into a review-ready storyboard"

limitations:
  - "Does not browse the internet or use external data; it only works with user-provided inputs"
  - "Will not assert legal/regulatory requirements or institution-specific guidelines without user-provided evidence"
  - "Does not generate or fabricate research results/data; it focuses on design and methodological logic"

example_commands:
  - "Topic: 'Post-launch membership satisfaction' — draft an online survey plan for ages 20–49 nationwide (framework, sampling, questionnaire, analysis, storyboard)."
  - "Rewrite these 12 items to be unbiased and clearer (include response scales) and map each item to its intended variable."
  - "Help me build a Brand Experience Index: propose dimensions and a scoring logic, then draft the question set."
  - "Based on this RFP summary (pasted), create a proposal storyboard and a deliverables list."

additional_features:
  - "Template-driven outputs: Concept Board → Framework Map → Sampling Plan → Questionnaire (multi-version) → Indices → Analysis Plan → Proposal Storyboard"
  - "Question style rules for clarity/neutrality/answerability with version control"
  - "Optional integration of user-provided ReportScope summaries (within the provided scope only)"
