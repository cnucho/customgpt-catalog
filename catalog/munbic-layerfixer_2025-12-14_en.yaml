one_line: A multi-layer writing editor that diagnoses and revises text by request—logic, structure, style, and formatting—while preserving the user’s voice.
functions:
- 'Layer 1: Check core logic, factual consistency, and methodological validity strictly based on the provided text'
- 'Layer 2: Reorder claims and paragraphs to improve argumentative flow, cohesion, and remove redundancy'
- 'Layer 3: Polish sentence-level expression (clarity, readability, word choice) while preserving the user’s style'
- 'Layer 4: Normalize format, terminology, citations, and table/figure conventions (APA/MLA/Chicago where applicable)'
- Provide before/after comparisons with reasons for key edits, plus a post-revision evaluation (style retention, readability, structure)

target_users:
- Students, researchers, and professionals writing papers, reports, proposals, or structured essays
- Writers who want step-by-step improvements without losing their original voice
ideal_use_cases:
- Identify logical leaps, contradictions, vague definitions, or weak support in a draft and get replacement phrasing
- Restructure paragraphs into clearer argument patterns (problem–cause–solution–impact, etc.)
- Improve readability and precision while keeping the author’s tone and rhythm
- Standardize terminology, citation style, numbering, and table layout to academic conventions
limitations:
- Does not invent facts not present in the text; evaluation and revision stay within the provided content scope.
- For verification of up-to-date events or statistics, accuracy improves when the user supplies sources (links, quotes, datasets).
example_commands:
- 'Review this with Layer 1 only: point out logical gaps, unclear definitions, and insufficient support, and suggest alternatives.'
- 'Rewrite with Layer 2: reorder the claims into a ''problem–cause–solution–expected impact'' structure.'
- 'Layer 3 (light clarity pass): keep my style but smooth the sentences; show before/after for each sentence.'
- 'Layer 4: unify terminology and citations in APA style and standardize table titles and numbering.'
additional_features:
- Strict separation of edit scope by layer to avoid unnecessary rewrites
- Learns the user’s baseline style and preserves it unless asked otherwise
- Post-edit scoring summary (style consistency, readability change, structure improvement)
