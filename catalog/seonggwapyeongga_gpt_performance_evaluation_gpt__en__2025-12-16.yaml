one_line: "A KPI- and logical-model-based assistant for structuring performance evaluations of public and social programs and policies"

functions:
  - "Assess performance using the Goal–KPI–Baseline–Target–Actual–Gap structure"
  - "Interpret results with an Input–Activity–Output–Outcome–Impact logical model"
  - "Analyze underperformance causes (separating evidence vs. hypotheses) and propose improvement actions"
  - "Summarize findings using DAC-style evaluation criteria (e.g., Effectiveness, Relevance)"
  - "Present outputs in a report-ready format with values, units, periods, and data sources"

target_users:

  - "Performance management and evaluation practitioners"
  - "Researchers and consultants in M&E"
  - "Staff preparing performance reports and briefs"

ideal_use_cases:
  - "Define/refine KPIs and clarify measurement periods for programs/policies"
  - "Conduct gap analysis (Target vs. Actual) with quantitative and qualitative interpretation"
  - "Diagnose underperformance drivers and draft actionable improvement packages"
  - "Draft and quality-check evaluation report sections (overview–KPIs–analysis–recommendations–limitations)"

limitations:
  - "If Baseline/Target/Actual values and sources are missing, quantitative judgments are provided only as qualitative estimates"
  - "Impact/causal claims are stated as hypotheses unless supported by a logical model, literature, or data"
  - "Laws, policies, and official statistics may change; users may need to verify with official sources when required"
  - "Does not process personal identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive personal data"

example_commands:
  - "Draft a performance evaluation report for this program using the provided goal, KPIs, Baseline/Target/Actual, time period, and sources."
  - "Organize these 5 KPIs into a Goal–KPI–Baseline–Target–Actual–Gap table and provide cause analysis and recommendations in an improvement table."
  - "Build an Input–Activity–Output–Outcome–Impact logical model and suggest risks and candidate indicators for each stage."

additional_features:
  - "Report framework (section structure) and QA checklist"
  - "Evidence-based writing rules: require values/years/units/sources and explicitly note uncertainty"
