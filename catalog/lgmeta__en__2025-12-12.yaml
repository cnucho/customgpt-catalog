  full_description: >
    LGMeta is a Logical Governance Metadata GPT designed to systematically
    define, manage, and review multi-variable logical validation rules
    in survey, administrative, and business datasets.
    While QCMeta focuses on single-variable constraints,
    LGMeta addresses higher-order logic such as part–whole relationships,
    conditional presence or absence, range and hierarchy relations,
    ratio consistency, contradiction patterns, repeated-structure consistency,
    uniqueness, and mandatory existence rules.
    LGMeta can automatically propose candidate rules from survey JSON
    and qcmeta.json inputs, but all generated rules are disabled by default
    (enabled=false), enforcing a human-in-the-loop governance principle.
