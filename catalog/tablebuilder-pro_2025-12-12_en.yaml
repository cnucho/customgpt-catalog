one_line: "A specialized TableBuilder GPT that structures statistical and text inputs into a table-focused DSL and designs, normalizes, and renders tables for reports."

functions:
  - "Defines table structures for statistical and text-based tables using normalized table_input and text_table_input schemas."
  - "Designs rows, columns, and cell layouts plus alignment and highlighting rules, and fixes them as reusable DSL templates."
  - "Supports batch_production_mode to mass-produce multiple similar tables from a single template."
  - "Provides rendering rules for final outputs such as Markdown and Excel, and generates Python code snippets when needed."
  - "Guides how to normalize SPSS, Excel, and Python outputs into dedicated table input formats."

alias:
  - "tablebuilder-pro"
  - "table-dsl-gpt"

tags:
  - "policy"
  - "statistics"
  - "research-assistant"

target_users:
  - "Analysts and researchers who must repeatedly produce complex tables for policy and research reports."
  - "Data and research teams that need to organize survey and statistical results into consistent table formats."

ideal_use_cases:
  - "Defining table structures and DSL templates for survey and statistical analysis results based on the table_input schema."
  - "Designing structured comparison or summary tables from text-based descriptions such as pros/cons and key features."
  - "Batch-generating multiple distribution tables (e.g., by age, region, income) that share the same axes."
  - "Converting SPSS or Excel outputs into consistent Markdown/Excel tables for inclusion in reports."

limitations:
  - "Does not analyze raw data or compute statistics; it only structures already-computed results and normalized inputs into tables."
  - "Does not invent or guess content; it designs and normalizes tables strictly within the scope of user-provided inputs."
  - "Assumes that any sensitive personal data is already anonymized and aggregated before being converted into table inputs."

example_commands:
  - "Normalize this crosstab output into the table_input schema and design an age-by-gender distribution table DSL."
  - "From the following pros/cons text, design a 3-column comparison table (text_to_table_mode) and show a Markdown preview."
  - "From this SPSS frequency output, create batch-production DSL templates for three tables (age, region, education)."
  - "Explain step by step how to normalize this Excel sheet into table_input and provide an example JSON."
  - "Define a DSL template for a policy-options comparison table, including row/column structure and highlighting rules."
  - "Using the templates we have created so far, outline a batch_production_mode workflow for reusing them with a second-wave survey dataset."

additional_features:
  - "Offers three operation modes—interactive_report_mode, batch_production_mode, and text_to_table_mode—to match different table design scenarios."
  - "Relies on auxiliary specs such as tablebuilder_dsl_core.yaml and tablebuilder_io_data.yaml to keep DSL and input schemas consistent."
