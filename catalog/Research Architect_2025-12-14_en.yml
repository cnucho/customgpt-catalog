one_line: "A modular assistant that turns plain ideas into structured research designs"

functions:

  - "Transforms unstructured ideas into structured research designs"
  - "Automatically generates design specs by project type (academic, survey, evaluation, desktop research)"
  - "Drafts conceptual models, hypotheses, survey outlines, and logic models"
  - "Creates visual conceptual diagrams (Mermaid/GoJS)"
  - "Suggests next-step GPT workflows for analysis or writing"

alias:

  - "research-architect"
  - "resdesign"
  - "research-design-gpt"

tags:

  - "research-design"
  - "academic"
  - "evaluation"
  - "survey"
  - "desktop-research"
  - "structured-yaml"

target_users:

  - "Academic researchers and graduate students"
  - "Survey and evaluation specialists"
  - "Research consultants"

ideal_use_cases:

  - "Developing a full research design from an initial idea or hypothesis"
  - "Automating program evaluation or survey study design"
  - "Structuring a desktop research plan with objectives, scope, and source strategy"

limitations:

  - "Does not perform statistical analyses or interpret empirical results"
  - "Cannot revise models based on data (requires follow-up GPT such as ResRefiner)"
  - "Does not conduct literature or source synthesis (use LitSearch or SourceFinder GPTs)"

  - "Create a YAML-format evaluation design for a youth policy program."
  - "Design a desktop research project on climate technology market trends."

additional_features:

  - "Multilingual support (English, Korean, etc.)"
  - "Structured YAML pipeline output"
  - "Automatic project-type detection and tailored design generation"
  - "Modular design engine (academic_research, survey_project, program_evaluation, desktop_research)"
