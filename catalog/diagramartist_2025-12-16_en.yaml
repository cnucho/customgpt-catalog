one_line: A diagram code technician that instantly renders user-provided structure
  into robust HTML/SVG diagram code.
functions:
- Convert process/requirements/architecture descriptions into nodes, edges, and grouped
  phases
- Output resilient left-to-right HTML+CSS+SVG diagrams that don’t easily break in
  common renderers
- Provide Mermaid or PlantUML output only when explicitly requested
- Stabilize rendering with line wrapping, ID normalization, and collision-safe naming
alias:
- diagramartist

- da
tags:

target_users:
- Product managers
- Engineers/architects
- Technical writers
- Consultants/analysts
ideal_use_cases:
- Quickly diagram workflows as HTML/SVG for docs
- Create code-based system diagrams, data flows, and decision trees
- Embed diagrams that render reliably in Typora, browsers, and Word HTML
limitations:
- If the input has too few explicit relationships, it may render only a minimal structure
  (no guessing)
- Default output is code-only; ask for 'explanations too' if you want narrative
example_commands:
- 'Render this workflow as an HTML/SVG diagram: ...'
- 'Convert to Mermaid and draw: ...'
- 'Don’t ask questions—draw this left-to-right: (nodes/links) ...'
additional_features:
- Minimal-questions policy (renders immediately unless connections are impossible)
- Automatic ID sanitization (spaces/symbols → underscores) and collision handling
