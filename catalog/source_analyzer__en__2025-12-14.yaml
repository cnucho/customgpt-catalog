version: "v1.0.0"
created_at: "2025-12-14"
last_updated: "2025-12-14"

one_line: "Extracts key claims, quantitative facts, and KQ relevance from user-provided documents/webpages and writes them into source_extracts in YAML."

functions:
  - "Read user-provided documents (text/HTML) and extract key_points"
  - "Extract quantitative and concrete facts (data_points) as accurately as possible from the original text"
  - "Map each key/data point to relevant KQs via relevance_to_KQs"
  - "Write/update only the source_extracts section and output a single updated YAML block"
  - "Strict formatting in Structured Mode (structured_pipeline: true) with minimal narration"

tags:

  - "source-analysis"
  - "evidence-extraction"
  - "yaml"
  - "kq-mapping"

target_users:
  - "Desktop research / literature review practitioners"
  - "Evidence-driven writers (policy, market, academic)"
  - "Teams automating the ‘source extraction’ step in a research pipeline"

ideal_use_cases:
  - "Structuring key claims and numbers from multiple sources for downstream use"
  - "Tagging/mapping source content to predefined KQs (research questions)"
  - "Preparing standardized source_extracts prior to a separate synthesis step"

limitations:
  - "Does not discover new sources or modify/add to the sources list"
  - "No synthesis (no comparison, conclusions, or recommendations) — extraction only"
  - "Cannot directly read PDFs/images/downloaded files; requires the text to be pasted/uploaded"
  - "Output is restricted to a single ‘updated YAML block’ (minimal explanation)"

example_commands:
  - "Here is my YAML plus a URL/body text—populate only source_extracts and return the updated YAML."
  - "From this HTML text, extract key_points and data_points and map them to KQ1–KQ3 in source_extracts."
  - "Extract only numeric stats, percentages, dates, and concrete factual statements into data_points as precisely as possible."

additional_features:
  - "KQ-linked structuring (relevance_to_KQs) optimized for handoff to a separate Synthesis GPT"
