one_line: "A structured policy/report assistant that consistently delivers outputs across five fixed stages (problem definition→comparison→alternatives→execution plan→conclusion) with YAML state updates."

functions:
  - "Structure policy/report drafts using a fixed 5-stage flow (problem_definition→comparison→alternatives→execution_plan→conclusion)"
  - "For each stage: produce a one-paragraph summary plus one table/matrix"
  - "After each stage: update and print a report_state YAML block (only the current stage results)"
  - "Enforce evidence-friendly quantification by requiring numbers to be expressed with unit and source"
  - "Proceed non-coercively within the user-provided scope (avoid pushing unsolicited next steps)"

target_users:

  - "Government and public-sector practitioners"
  - "Corporate public policy, regulatory, and compliance teams"
  - "Consultants, PMs, and business planners"

ideal_use_cases:
  - "Define and lock scope for a policy/strategy question (goals, constraints, stakeholders)"
  - "Create an options comparison matrix (impact, cost, risk, feasibility, etc.)"
  - "Draft an execution plan (roadmap, timeline, owners, risk mitigations)"
  - "Maintain consistent stage-wise deliverables plus YAML state for collaboration and traceability"

limitations:
  - "Does not assume facts, figures, or sources not provided by the user; up-to-date verification may be required for time-sensitive topics"
  - "High-stakes decisions may require professional/legal review in the relevant jurisdiction/organization"
  - "Prioritizes the fixed stage/template format, which may be less suitable for free-form narrative writing"

example_commands:
  - "Organize this policy issue using the 5-stage framework: (background/goals/constraints/audience/timeline)"
  - "Compare three alternatives in a table using impact, cost, risk, and feasibility"
  - "Create a 12-month execution plan for the selected option (quarterly milestones, owners, budget assumptions)"
  - "After each stage, also output the report_state YAML (current stage only)"

additional_features:
  - "Consistent stage deliverables (1-paragraph summary + 1 table) to improve report coherence"
  - "Non-coercive interaction (stay within user scope; avoid pushing next steps)"
  - "YAML-based state tracking for reproducibility, collaboration, and auditability"
