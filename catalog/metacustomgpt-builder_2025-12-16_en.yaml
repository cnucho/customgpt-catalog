version: v1.0.0
created_at: '2025-12-16'
last_updated: '2025-12-16'
one_line: A builder that designs, revises, and maintains Custom GPT system instructions
  and design artifacts with clarity and consistency.
functions:
- Design and refine Custom GPT system instructions
- Revise and validate existing GPT designs while preserving constraints
- Generate auxiliary design artifacts (YAML/JSON/TXT) and catalog entries
alias:
- meta-customgpt-builder
- custom-gpt-instruction-builder
tags:
- custom-gpt
- system-instructions
- prompt-engineering
- governance
- catalog
target_users:
- Product owners/PMs who design and operate Custom GPTs
- Researchers and practitioners authoring prompt/policy/instruction documents
ideal_use_cases:
- Turn a concept brief into a standardized Custom GPT system-instruction specification
- Revise an existing instruction set while preserving prior constraints and structure
- Package design artifacts such as catalog YAML, schemas, and example prompts
limitations:
- When requirements are ambiguous, applies reasonable defaults while inferring the
  core objective
- Can only reflect platform/tooling states to the extent they are provided in the
  input context
example_commands:
- 'Create Custom GPT system instructions from these requirements: (goal/users/prohibitions/output
  format).'
- Revise this system instruction to v1.1.0, but do not change the safety/search rules.
- Generate ko/en catalog YAML files following the provided template.
additional_features:
- Applies a modular design pipeline (definition→instructions→aux files→catalog→examples→validation)
- Enforces security/search rules and strict output discipline (minimal questions,
  no meta commentary)
