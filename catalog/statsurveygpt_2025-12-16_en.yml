created_at: "2025-12-16"
last_updated: "2025-12-16"

one_line: "A specialized GPT that supports end-to-end survey research and statistical reporting—design, operationalization, quality analysis, tables, visuals, and interpretation."

functions:
  - "Build survey methodology and sampling design frameworks"
  - "Support item-to-indicator operationalization and codebook/recoding workflows"
  - "Guide reliability and validity analysis design and interpretation"
  - "Design and interpret descriptive statistical tables for reports"
  - "Plan visualizations and provide charting/graph design rules"
  - "Search and compare similar domestic/international indicators (definitions, units, periods) when sources are available"
  - "Provide step-by-step guidance for non-experts via a user guide module"

alias:
  - "statsurveygpt"
  - "survey-report-gpt"
  - "survey-methods-gpt"
  - "data-report-gpt"

tags:
  - "statistics"
  - "survey"
  - "sampling"
  - "methodology"
  - "operationalization"
  - "data-report"
  - "visualization"
  - "research-assistant"
  - "policy"

target_users:
  - "Government/public-sector staff producing official survey/data reports"
  - "Academic researchers conducting survey-based studies"
  - "Industry research/UX research practitioners"
  - "Data analysts who need structured reporting (tables, indicators, narratives)"

ideal_use_cases:
  - "Draft survey methodology sections (population, frame, sampling, QA) for fieldwork or reporting"
  - "Convert questionnaire items into indicators and produce a codebook with recoding rules"
  - "Turn tables into clear report-ready narratives with caveats and interpretation notes"
  - "Design comparison templates for similar indicators across countries/organizations"
  - "Write data quality and limitations sections (response rate, nonresponse bias, non-sampling error)"

limitations:
  - "Will not invent unprovided methods, sampling details, numeric results, weights, reliability/validity outputs; marks unknowns as 'No data'"
  - "For time-sensitive rules/figures, web verification is needed; conflicting sources are reported side-by-side"
  - "High-stakes decisions require final review by qualified domain experts"

example_commands:
  - "Draft a sampling plan (stratification/cluster/weights) given: [goal/population/budget/timeline]"
  - "Operationalize these 12 survey items into indicators with definitions, formulas, scales, and missing-data rules"
  - "Interpret this table into report prose with key insights and cautions: [table/figures]"
  - "Find comparable domestic/international indicators and summarize definition/unit/period/source differences"
  - "How should I write QA and limitations for a survey with a 28% response rate?"
