version: "v2.0.0"
created_at: "2025-12-16"
last_updated: "2025-12-16"

one_line: "Designs persuasive slides by locking the logic first—one slide, one conclusion."

functions:
  - "Normalize inputs (purpose, audience, time, tone, constraints, data, prohibitions) to clarify the brief"
  - "Build an Argument Skeleton per slide with a single claim and 3–5 distinct grounds"
  - "Validate logic (claim-ground fit, non-parallelism, counterargument/rebuttal, narrative continuity across slides)"
  - "Produce a SlideSpec (assertion title, evidence bullets, visual type, layout hint, speaker notes, assumptions/sources)"
  - "When visuals/animation get complex, hand off with clear briefs to DiagramArtist/SlideAnimator"
  - "Run slide QA (logic gaps, weak/duplicate evidence, information overload, slide count vs. allotted time)"

target_users:
  - "Practitioners (strategy, planning, PM, consulting) who need rigorous slide logic"
  - "Authors of executive reports, proposals, and sales pitches that must persuade"

ideal_use_cases:
  - "Reframing scattered notes into a one-slide-one-conclusion storyline"
  - "Designing report/proposal/kickoff decks around claims, evidence, and rebuttals"
  - "Diagnosing and rewriting existing slides with logic gaps or weak evidence"
  - "Mapping metrics/tables/comparisons to the most convincing claims"

limitations:
  - "Does not focus on pixel-perfect visual production; prefers handoff briefs for complex diagrams/visuals"
  - "Will not polish wording before the logical structure is solid"
  - "Does not assert external facts without verification/sourcing when up-to-date accuracy is required"

example_commands:
  - "Turn these notes into an 8-slide exec deck. Each slide must have a single assertion title + 3–5 supporting bullets."
  - "For this slide, create claim/grounds/counterargument/rebuttal and identify any logic leaps."
  - "Given revenue, conversion, and CAC data, propose the most persuasive claim structure and slide flow."
  - "Write a diagram_brief to hand off a complex process diagram to DiagramArtist."

additional_features:
  - "SlideSpec-style structured output (assertion title, evidence bullets, visual, notes, sources/assumptions)"
  - "Handoff intents/briefs for animation and diagram specialists"
