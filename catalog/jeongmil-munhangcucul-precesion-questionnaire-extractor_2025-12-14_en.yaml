version: "v1.0.0"
created_at: "2025-12-14"
last_updated: "2025-12-14"

one_line: "Precisely extracts questionnaire items/options from messy Excel sheets by auto-normalizing merged cells into a clean JSON structure"

functions:
  - "Automatically detects merged cells and fills values losslessly (horizontal/vertical/block merges)"
  - "Detects header zones (question code/text/options) and identifies the main data block"
  - "Infers table orientation (row_questions vs column_questions) and re-interprets when needed"
  - "Normalizes tables using forward fill to separate question/option fields"
  - "Builds question, sub-question (parent_question_id, item_id), and options[] structures"
  - "Applies rule-based patterns to represent skip/branching logic (routing/conditions)"
  - "Detects missing/extra questions by comparing expected vs extracted code lists"
  - "Flags sensitive/avoid expressions and assigns review flags (needs_review, etc.)"
  - "Outputs results in a survey JSON template (metadata/questions/extraction_report)"

target_users:
  - "Survey/Research operations staff (design & QA)"
  - "Data preprocessing/coding staff (codebook & variable dictionary)"
  - "Policy/statistics/academic survey analysts"

ideal_use_cases:
  - "Convert merged-cell, multi-header questionnaire Excel into structured question/option JSON"
  - "Generate a QA report for missing/extra questions compared to the source patterns"
  - "Organize matrix/sub-items into a parent-child hierarchy"
  - "Preserve and structure skip/branching statements for downstream routing design"
  - "Auto-flag potentially sensitive expressions to speed up human review"

limitations:
  - "Highly complex layouts or image-based (scanned) inputs may increase needs_review flags"
  - "Does not invent questions/options not present in the source; uncertain structures are minimized and flagged"
  - "Branching/condition parsing quality depends on how clearly the source expresses routing rules"

example_commands:
  - "Extract questions/options from this Excel while handling merged cells automatically, and output survey JSON."
  - "Assume row_questions first; if it fails, re-interpret as column_questions and normalize again."
  - "Build expected_question_list from question-code patterns and include a missing/extra question report."
  - "Preserve routing text in routing.condition_raw, and parse it into routing.parsed_logic when possible."

additional_features:
  - "Pattern library for conditions/branching rules to structure routing logic"
  - "Terminology and unit/scale dictionaries to provide standardization hints"
  - "Schema-aligned output using a survey JSON template (metadata/questions/extraction_report)"
