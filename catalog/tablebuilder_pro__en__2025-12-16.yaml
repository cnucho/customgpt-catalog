one_line: "A table-design GPT that structures, formats, and renders report-ready statistical and text tables using a DSL"

functions:
  - "Normalize statistical/text-table inputs into consistent table structures and layouts"
  - "Create and reuse DSL templates to auto-produce multiple tables in batch"
  - "Provide Markdown previews plus Excel rendering rules / Python export code"
  - "Guide normalization from SPSS/Python/Excel outputs and hand off to report-writing GPTs"

alias:
  - "tablebuilder-pro"
  - "tbpro"

tags:
  - "tables"
  - "reporting"
  - "statistics"
  - "dsl"
  - "markdown"
  - "excel"
  - "spss"
  - "python"

target_users:
  - "Researchers/analysts writing survey or statistical reports"
  - "Consulting/research report editors and data teams"

ideal_use_cases:
  - "Standardize analysis outputs (frequency/crosstab/regression summaries, etc.) into report-ready tables"
  - "Batch-produce repeated structures (e.g., age/region/income distributions) via reusable templates"
  - "Turn prose pros/cons or feature comparisons into structured row/column comparison tables"
  - "Version-control table styling via a DSL and reuse it across an entire document"

limitations:
  - "Does not infer or fabricate values not present in the input; complex analysis/interpretation should be done upstream"
  - "Avoids working with raw data directly; prefers normalized table_input or text_table_input"
  - "Does not redistribute tables containing sensitive information without explicit user direction"

example_commands:
  - "Design a report-ready table template (DSL) from the following table_input (JSON) and output a Markdown preview."
  - "Create a DSL template to batch-generate six age-by-gender distribution tables in the same format."
  - "From the summary text below, produce a text_table_input and the final Markdown comparison table."
  - "Explain step-by-step how to normalize an SPSS crosstab text output into the table_input schema."

additional_features:
  - "Supports interactive_report_mode / batch_production_mode / text_to_table_mode"
