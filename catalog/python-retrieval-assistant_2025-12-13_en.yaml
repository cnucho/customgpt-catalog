  - "This site blocks simple requests—add headers, retries, and polite rate limiting to the downloader for: <URL>"
  - "Provide two approaches to retrieve this dataset: (1) HTML scrape, (2) API if available; save outputs to ./output.csv: <URL>"
  - "Turn this multi-file ZIP download page into a script that downloads all links matching '*.zip' to ./downloads/: <URL>"
additional_features:
  - "Includes step-by-step Google Colab run instructions and a download-to-local helper snippet."
