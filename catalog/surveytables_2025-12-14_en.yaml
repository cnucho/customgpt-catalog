one_line: "A survey analysis assistant that turns tables or tidy data into reproducible crosstabs, descriptives, charts, and report-ready outputs"

functions:
  - "Extract integer frequencies from table cells, excluding total/overall rows and columns, and convert to long/pivot formats"
  - "Preprocess tidy data (type inference + missing/outlier checks) and produce descriptive summaries"
  - "Run crosstab inference (Chi-square / Fisher when needed) and report effect size (Cramér’s V)"
  - "Keep narratives consistent across tables/charts/text by grounding everything in a persistent ‘interpretation object’"
  - "Provide Excel-style report structure guidance and reproducibility logging"

tags:
  - "survey"
  - "crosstab"
  - "descriptive-statistics"
  - "reporting"
  - "reproducibility"
  - "excel"

target_users:
  - "Research / research operations teams who need fast, standardized survey tabulation"
  - "Analysts and PMs who want consistent, report-ready tables and charts"
  - "Policy and academic researchers who rely on crosstabs and effect-size-oriented interpretation"

ideal_use_cases:
  - "Paste a frequency/crosstab table, drop totals, extract counts only, and rebuild a clean crosstab"
  - "Create Gender × Satisfaction crosstabs with significance testing and effect-size summaries"
  - "Generate categorical frequencies, numeric descriptives, and multi-response summaries in one pass"
  - "Operate a standardized reporting pipeline where identical inputs must yield identical outputs (with logs/seed)"

limitations:
  - "In table-ingestion mode, only standalone integers are treated as counts; percent-only cells may be ignored"
  - "Rows/columns labeled Total/Overall/Grand Total are excluded from analysis by default unless explicitly requested"
  - "Advanced options (codebook ordering, category collapsing strategy, weights, complex survey design) require explicit user instructions"

example_commands:
  - "Turn this table into a crosstab. Exclude totals, and show counts + row percentages."
  - "Build a crosstab for Gender (columns) × Satisfaction (rows) and summarize Chi-square + Cramér’s V."
  - "From this dataframe, produce frequency tables for categorical variables and mean/SD/95% CI for numeric variables."
  - "Keep the same message, but change formatting only (e.g., 1 decimal place) without recomputing the analysis."

additional_features:
  - "Rule-based ingestion that drops Total/Overall labels and extracts integer-only frequencies from cells"
  - "Quality checks for missingness (exclude by threshold / listwise deletion) and outlier detection with logging"
  - "Built-in table/chart policies (row% default, totals as counts-only, optional sparse-category merge to ‘Other’)"
  - "Persistent interpretation object + decision engine that distinguishes formatting-only changes vs analysis changes"
  - "Excel-oriented output structure and reproducibility logging fields"
