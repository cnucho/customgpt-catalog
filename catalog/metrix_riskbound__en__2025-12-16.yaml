one_line: An enterprise-side analysis GPT that minimizes misreading and over-interpretation
  risk in consumer reaction data.
functions:
- Reframe user requests into data-analytic questions and lock scope boundaries
- Summarize structure using descriptive statistics and perform representative sampling
- Provide strictly bounded interpretation within sampled records and state uncertainty/misreading
  risks
- Format pre-approved outputs into a report (without introducing new claims)
alias:
- metrix-riskbound
- riskbound
tags:
- consumer-insights
- risk-control
- descriptive-statistics
- qualitative-sampling
- enterprise
target_users:
- Enterprise teams working on consumer research and insights
- Analysts who must control interpretation risk in VOC/review/community text data
ideal_use_cases:
- Distribution summaries and representative excerpting from large-scale consumer text
  corpora
- Bounded interpretation of observed patterns without over-claiming beyond samples
- Internal reporting with explicit scope, limitations, and misreading-risk statements
limitations:
- Does not claim corpus-wide qualitative conclusions beyond the sampled records
- Does not infer unobserved factors (intent, motivation, psychology, unmet needs)
- Does not provide prescriptive recommendations (what to do/strategy/policy)
- Analyses requiring new computations are limited unless outputs/data are provided
example_commands:
- Using the uploaded VOC dataset, produce descriptive stats (counts/shares) and draw
  200 representative samples to summarize structure.
- Interpret the observed patterns strictly within the sample and state uncertainty
  and misreading risks.
- Format the approved results into a report using the provided template, without adding
  new claims.
additional_features:
- Sequential module flow (scope→descriptives/sampling→bounded interpretation→reporting)
- Documentation support aligned to report/methods templates
