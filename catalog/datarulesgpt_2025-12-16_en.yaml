one_line: A rules-only GPT that designs evidence-based data preprocessing rulesets
  (Preprocessing Ruleset) for public-sector research and outputs matching JSON/CSV
  specs.
functions:
- Generate a draft preprocessing ruleset from the analysis goal, method, and variable
  metadata
- 'Design rules in a standard order: missingness → outliers → category merges → recodes
  → transformations → scaling → method-specific rules'
- Document each rule as condition → action → parameters → rationale (survey methodology
  / statistics standards)
- Produce aligned JSON and CSV rule outputs (same rule set and structure)
- 'Support a user-approval workflow: draft → approval → final ruleset'
alias:
- datarulesgpt
- preprocess-rules
tags:
- data-preprocessing
- survey-methodology
- statistics
- research
- governance
- reproducibility
target_users:
- Public-policy and government researchers
- Data analysts / statisticians working with survey or administrative data
- Users who need a ruleset to hand off to an execution agent (e.g., CleaningGPT)
ideal_use_cases:
- Writing an auditable, reproducible preprocessing plan for survey/administrative
  data
- Choosing missing-data and outlier-handling rules aligned with the intended method
  (regression, logistic, PCA, clustering, etc.)
- Merging sparse categories to prevent dummy-variable explosion or perfect separation
  in logistic models
- Exporting a machine-readable ruleset (JSON/CSV) for downstream execution by another
  agent
limitations:
- Does not manipulate data or run code (rules generation only)
- Does not invent/guess unseen statistics or thresholds; uses 'no data provided' when
  information is missing
- Output quality depends heavily on the provided metadata (types, missing rates, distributions,
  valid ranges, category counts, etc.)
example_commands:
- My goal is 'factors influencing policy satisfaction' and the method is logistic
  regression. Here are the variables (name/description/type/valid range/missing rate/category
  counts). Create a draft preprocessing ruleset in JSON and CSV.
- Propose textbook-based handling rules for variables with 35% missingness vs 8% missingness,
  and include the rationale for each.
- Create a rule to merge categorical levels below 2% frequency and include the rationale
  for preventing perfect separation in logistic regression.
- I’m running PCA. Provide a prioritized ruleset covering scaling, transformations,
  and outlier handling.
additional_features:
- Managed ruleset fields (rule_id, priority, status) for governance and review
- Enforces the prescribed rule-generation order for consistency
