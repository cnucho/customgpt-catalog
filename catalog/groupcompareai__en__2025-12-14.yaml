one_line: "Automatically designs and runs group-difference, equivalence (TOST), and non-inferiority tests on uploaded data, and reports multiplicity-adjusted results with effect sizes, CIs, and power/MDE in APA style."

functions:
  - "Data preprocessing & diagnostics (missingness/outliers/skewness/cluster-panel detection) with actionable recommendations"
  - "Automatic test selection & execution for group comparisons (t/Welch/Mann–Whitney, ANOVA/Welch ANOVA, chi-square/exact tests, etc.)"
  - "Covariate adjustment (ANCOVA) and clustered/panel data handling recommendations (cluster-robust SE, mixed-effects models)"
  - "Multiple-testing correction (Holm default; Bonferroni/BH options) with controlled correction scope"
  - "Effect sizes with confidence intervals (Cohen d/Hedges g, η²/ω², risk difference/RR/OR, etc.) and interpretation templates"
  - "Equivalence & non-inferiority testing (TOST with 90% CI) using configurable equivalence margins (Δ)"
  - "Power & sample planning (a priori/post hoc power, MDE) with automatic low-power warnings"
  - "Subgroup analysis & interaction checks (interaction p-values, concise heterogeneity summary; forest-plot recommendations)"
  - "Report generation with summary cards, detailed tables/figures, and appendix (code/logs) in APA statistical reporting style"
  - "Multilingual reporting support (Korean/English and major SEA languages) via i18n resources"

target_users:
  - "Researchers and data analysts running group comparisons on experiments/surveys/observational data"
  - "Product and growth teams (A/B testing, multiple metrics, standardized reporting)"
  - "Academic/policy analysts who need effect sizes, power/MDE, and equivalence claims"
  - "Consultants/analytics owners who want consistent statistical reporting pipelines"

ideal_use_cases:
  - "End-to-end A/B testing reports (significance + effect size + multiplicity correction) for multiple KPIs"
  - "Make an equivalence claim (not just ‘non-significant’) via TOST with a justified margin Δ"
  - "Compute MDE and recommend re-testing when power is insufficient"
  - "Compare effects across countries/segments and assess interactions"
  - "Estimate adjusted group differences using ANCOVA (e.g., baseline-controlled outcomes)"

limitations:
  - "Equivalence/non-inferiority conclusions are highly sensitive to the chosen margin Δ; unjustified margins can undermine interpretability."
  - "Causal interpretation is limited for observational data due to potential confounding; additional design/estimation strategies may be required."
  - "Small samples, rare events, or complex clustering may require exact tests or advanced mixed-model specifications beyond simple defaults."

example_commands:
  - "Compare CTR and CVR between variants A and B in my uploaded data, apply Holm correction, and report effect sizes, 95% CIs, and MDE."
  - "Test the mean difference in influencer_credibility between male and female; switch to Welch if variances differ."
  - "Run ANOVA across 5 countries with post-hoc tests; propose robust alternatives if normality is severely violated."
  - "Check whether A and B are equivalent using TOST (Δ: Cohen d=0.2) and report the decision clearly."
  - "Run subgroup analysis by age group × country and report interaction p-values and a heterogeneity summary."

additional_features:
  - "Default settings: alpha=0.05, CI=95%, TOST CI=90%, power target=0.80, Holm correction by default"
  - "UI toggles: plain-language vs technical summary, equivalence margin (Δ) on/off, correction method, subgroup analysis, language switch"
  - "Outputs: summary card (decision/effect size/MDE/recommendations) + detailed tables/figures + appendix (code/logs)"
