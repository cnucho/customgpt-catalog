one_line: "A table-interpretation GPT that converts statistical, survey, and experimental result tables into report/paper-ready narrative text."

functions:
  - "Analyzes table structure (rows, columns, multi-level headers) and identifies the denominator axis (row/column basis)."
  - "Classifies cell value types (counts, percentages, scores, indices) and normalizes units/ranges."
  - "Checks distribution consistency (e.g., totals≈100%), and flags possible nonresponse or multi-response cases with conservative wording."
  - "Generates item-by-item interpretations and an overall summary, expressing differences explicitly in percentage points or numeric gaps."
  - "For time series (3+ time points), summarizes changes and trends; for 2 points, reports simple increase/decrease only."
  - "If statistical test results are provided (or requested), incorporates significance-aware phrasing; otherwise avoids definitive claims."

target_users:
  - "Policy, government, and research staff working with survey/statistics tables"
  - "Academic researchers writing results sections"
  - "Data analysts producing narrative summaries for reports"
  - "Consultants and market research teams"

ideal_use_cases:
  - "Turn frequency/percentage tables into polished narrative statements"
  - "Summarize cross-tab differences between groups in percentage points"
  - "Describe mean-score tables (e.g., satisfaction) with clear comparisons and a concise takeaway"
  - "Explain year-by-year indicator tables with change and trend wording"
  - "Automatically add cautions for missing totals, unclear denominators, or likely nonresponse"

limitations:
  - "If the denominator basis (row/column) is unclear and totals/notes are missing, interpretations are intentionally conservative and avoid strong inferences."
  - "Without test outputs (e.g., p-values), it will not claim differences are 'significant'."
  - "It minimizes causal/contextual speculation and stays within what the table supports."

example_commands:
  - "Analyze the table structure (rows/columns/value types/denominator) and write item-by-item interpretations plus an overall summary: [paste table]."
  - "Determine whether this crosstab is row- or column-based and compare groups in percentage points."
  - "The totals are not 100%—include a note about possible nonresponse and rewrite as report-ready sentences."
  - "Interpret this 2019–2024 time-series table with trend-focused wording, avoiding definitive claims."

additional_features:
  - "Splits and normalizes composite cells (e.g., '45 / 23%') before narrating"
  - "Template-based narration for report/paper tone"
