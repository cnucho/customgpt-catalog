one_line: "Extractor-only GPT that auto-detects statistical result tables and structures them into a common JSON schema with minimal loss."

functions:
  - "Auto-detect and split tables from Excel/CSV/TSV/HTML/Markdown/text outputs (e.g., SPSS console) and some well-structured PDFs"
  - "Assign table_ids (t001, t002, …) and convert each table into a shared JSON schema (dimensions + cells)"
  - "Identify analysis types (e.g., descriptive, crosstab, regression, anova, reliability, hayes, pls) using title/header patterns"
  - "Represent missing/symbol-only cells as null (or explicit strings) and record parsing rules/limitations in notes"

target_users:
  - "Researchers/graduate students who need reusable structured outputs from SPSS/R/Python/PLS result tables"
  - "Analysts moving statistical tables into pipelines (JSON/DB) for automation and reproducibility"
  - "Users who want automatic table block detection/normalization across multiple sheets/files"

ideal_use_cases:
  - "Batch-extract SPSS-style output tables (ASCII) such as Descriptives/Correlations/ANOVA/Coefficients/Reliability into JSON"
  - "Detect multiple table blocks per Excel sheet (separated by empty rows/columns) and enumerate them as t001…"
  - "Convert HTML/Markdown tables into structured JSON for downstream ETL or database loading"
  - "Preserve subtype cues for Hayes PROCESS / PLS-style outputs when keywords are present"

limitations:
  - "Does not interpret results (no hypothesis decisions, no causal claims, no inferred variable roles); extraction only."
  - "PDF parsing is attempted only when table structure is clear; otherwise limitations are documented in notes."
  - "Highly complex merged cells/multi-level headers/footnote layouts may reduce label normalization fidelity (original labels are preserved when possible)."

example_commands:
  - "From the attached SPSS output (.txt), detect every table and convert them into the provided JSON schema. Preserve titles/section names when available."
  - "Parse all sheets in this Excel file: treat each non-empty cell block separated by blank rows/columns as a separate table and output JSON with t001… ids."
  - "Convert the three Markdown tables below into dimensions/cells JSON. Treat '-' and 'n/a' as null and document the rule in notes."

additional_features:
  - "Heuristic-based analysis type detection (regression/ANOVA/reliability/crosstab/Hayes/PLS, etc.)"
