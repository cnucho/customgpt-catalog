one_line: "Generates realistic multi-dimensional synthetic data and exports cross-tab tables with metadata as ChartGPT-ready JSON."

functions:

  - "Interpret a topic prompt and auto-map relevant indicators/variables"
  - "Generate realistic simulated values (rule-based mean/std generation)"
  - "Design multi-dimensional cross-tab structures with 2+ conditioning variables"
  - "Attach interpretable metadata (unit, time range, source notes, etc.)"
  - "Output ChartGPT-compatible JSON in a table_state + data structure"

target_users:

  - "Data visualization and research practitioners"
  - "Policy / social-indicator analysts and planners"
  - "Dashboard and reporting builders"
  - "Instructors and students needing practice datasets"

ideal_use_cases:

  - "Create synthetic social-indicator datasets with conditioning variables (region/age/gender, etc.)"
  - "Rapidly design analysis-ready cross-tabs and export them as JSON"
  - "Prototype dashboards when real data is missing or incomplete"
  - "Prepare data aligned to chart intents (comparison/trend/composition/distribution/relationship)"

limitations:

  - "Generated outputs are simulated and may differ from official statistics; validate against primary sources for decisions."
  - "For sensitive domains (medical/legal/financial), cross-check with up-to-date and authoritative references."

example_commands:

  - "Create 2020–2025 synthetic data for Happiness and Life Satisfaction across Seoul/Busan/Daegu, cross-tabbed by age group × gender, as JSON."
  - "Build a grouped-bar-ready table comparing remote-work productivity by role × work mode, including unit/source/time metadata."
  - "Output only table_state and data so I can visualize it directly in ChartGPT."

additional_features:

  - "Chart-type guidance by analytical intent (comparison/trend/composition/distribution/relationship)"
  - "Follows a standard cross-table template (merge/sort/style/metadata)"
  - "Applies a consistent color palette rule set for visualization coherence"
