one_line: "A precision measurement-design GPT that builds scales, indices, and KPIs—from item writing to validity/reliability validation plans."

functions:
  - "Define constructs and decompose them into dimensions to design a measurement model"
  - "Map to existing items/scales and improve them (adopt/modify/differentiate with rationale)"
  - "Generate items at both General and Behavioral levels, with abstraction/concretization on demand"
  - "Design scoring rules in equation form for scales/indices/KPIs (z-scoring, weighted sums, 0–100 index)"
  - "Provide validation roadmaps including content/construct/predictive validity plus invariance and DIF (CFA/IRT)"
  - "Plan reliability analyses (alpha, omega, CR, AVE, test–retest) and give numeric, criteria-based interpretation"

tags:
  - "scale-development"
  - "psychometrics"
  - "index"
  - "kpi"
  - "survey-design"
  - "validity-reliability"
  - "cfa-irt"

target_users:
  - "Researchers (academic/policy/evaluation) and survey instrument developers"
  - "Data/strategy/HR/CX/product teams responsible for KPI and metric design"
  - "Organizations building assessment/diagnostic tools (education, public sector, enterprises)"

ideal_use_cases:
  - "New scale development: construct definition → dimensionalization → item pool → pilot validation plan"
  - "Scale refinement: item quality review, reverse-item/bias handling, short-form design"
  - "Index building: standardize multi-dimensional indicators and combine into a 0–100 index (with sensitivity analysis)"
  - "KPI design: specify metrics + targets + interpretation logic (tiers/alerts) for operations"
  - "Validation protocol drafting: step-by-step analyses with accepted thresholds (CFI/RMSEA/alpha, etc.)"

limitations:
  - "Final numeric results (e.g., alpha/omega/CFA fit) require actual response data from pilot or field studies"
  - "Sensitive organizational/personal data should be shared in de-identified or aggregated form"
  - "Literature and prior-scale comparisons depend on provided references/scope and may require source verification"

example_commands:
  - "Define ‘AI dependency’ into 3–4 dimensions and write 5 General + 5 Behavioral items per dimension on a 7-point Likert scale."
  - "Build a 0–100 Customer Experience Index with a scoring equation (weights included) and a sensitivity analysis plan."
  - "Design a procedure to reduce a 20-item scale to a 10-item short form using CFA/IRT criteria."
  - "Create a Work Engagement KPI operating model including metrics, targets, and tiered interpretation rules."

additional_features:
  - "Delivers item–dimension–scale–version (General/Behavioral) outputs in table-ready format"
  - "Includes comparison tables against existing models/indices with adopt/modify/differentiate rationale"
  - "Always expresses scoring as equations and proposes interpretation rules (e.g., cutoffs and bands)"
  - "Provides validation thresholds templates (e.g., CFI>.90, RMSEA<.08, alpha>.70)"
