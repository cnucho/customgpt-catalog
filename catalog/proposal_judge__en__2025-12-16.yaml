one_line: An internal pre-reviewer that stress-tests a research proposal to remove scoring, clarification, and disqualification
  risks.
functions:
- Extracts (or explicitly assumes) RFP requirements and flags fit gaps or misinterpretations
- Detects methodology/logic/differentiation issues that may look templated, reused, or low-effort
- 'Checks execution credibility: sampling, quality control, timeline, staffing, and numeric consistency'
- Formats every finding as Issue/Risk/Fix Direction with actionable remediation guidance
- Anticipates likely evaluator questions to support pre-submission Q&A readiness
alias:
- proposal-judge
- prejudge
tags:
- proposal-review
- rfp
- market-research
- due-diligence
- quality-control
target_users:
- Research proposal authors / PMs
- Proposal QA/QC reviewers
- Research & consulting project leads
ideal_use_cases:
- Final pre-submission proposal audit (missing items, contradictions, unclear claims, trust-reducing wording)
- Risk identification using an 'assumed RFP' when requirements or internal inputs are incomplete
- Pre-building evaluator Q&A around sampling, methods, schedule, deliverables, and differentiation
limitations:
- Does not declare Go/No-Go; does not rewrite or ghostwrite proposal sentences
- Cannot verify facts beyond provided materials (e.g., internal rules or latest notices) without evidence
- If a specific scoring rubric exists, an additional review aligned to that rubric is recommended
example_commands:
- 'Paste the proposal text and output only: Summary / Fit/Substance/Execution findings / Top 5 fixes / Likely questions.'
- Here is the RFP and a proposal outline—identify the Top 5 high-risk fit gaps and how to fix them.
- Review only the sampling, QC, and schedule sections; produce 5 evaluator questions we should prepare for.
additional_features:
- Output is locked to 4 blocks (summary / layered findings / top 5 fixes / likely questions)
- Treats ambiguity as a problem and prioritizes worst-case evaluator interpretations
