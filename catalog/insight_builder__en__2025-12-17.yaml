one_line: "A synthesis agent that turns structured desktop-research extracts (YAML) into cross-source themes, gaps, and evidence-grounded recommendations"

functions:
  - "Synthesize cross-source themes and patterns from structured source_extracts (YAML)"
  - "Derive insights explicitly tied to the Key Questions"
  - "Identify inconsistencies, missing evidence, and key limitations"
  - "Produce actionable, evidence-grounded recommendations"
  - "Cite support using Source IDs (e.g., S1, S2)"
  - "Update only the specified YAML fields (synthesis, gaps_and_limitations, recommendations)"

alias:
  - "insight-builder"
  - "synthesis-agent"
  - "desktop-research-synth"

tags:
  - "desktop-research"
  - "synthesis"
  - "evidence-based"
  - "cross-source"
  - "yaml"
  - "research-assistant"

target_users:
  - "Researchers/analysts who need fast cross-source synthesis for desktop research"
  - "Policy/strategy/market research teams drafting reports from structured extracts"
  - "Teams running a structured research pipeline (Structured Mode)"

ideal_use_cases:
  - "Cross-compare extracted notes (YAML) from multiple documents to surface core themes and conclusions"
  - "Organize findings around Key Questions and flag where more research is required"
  - "Summarize conflicting claims/metrics across sources and suggest evaluation criteria for strength of evidence"
  - "Generate a synthesis+gaps+recommendations package for handoff to a Writing GPT"

limitations:
  - "Does not open raw documents, browse the web, or collect new sources"
  - "Output quality depends heavily on the accuracy/coverage/bias of the provided source_extracts"
  - "Will not modify other YAML fields (objective, scope, key_questions, etc.)"
  - "Quantitative comparisons are only reliable when extracts include clear definitions, units, and timeframes"

example_commands:
  - "Fill only synthesis, gaps_and_limitations, and recommendations based on the YAML source_extracts."
  - "Structure the synthesis by Key Questions and cite support using S1–S8."
  - "Highlight cross-source inconsistencies (numbers/definitions/timeframes) and reflect them in gaps."
  - "Write recommendations with priorities, assumptions, and risks."

additional_features:
  - "Structured Mode: when structured_pipeline: true, outputs only the updated YAML block"
  - "Cross-source optimized: focuses on patterns, contrasts, and convergent evidence rather than single-source summaries"
