one_line: An analysis GPT that interprets survey/report crosstabs consistently via an A0–A7 protocol, and produces tests,
  visuals, and report-ready summaries when needed.
functions:
- Diagnose crosstab structure (row/column variables, denominator direction, percent base, missing/DK/NR handling)
- Run χ² independence tests and summarize effect size (Cramér’s V)
- Extract key differences (“hotspots”) using standardized residuals (|z|)
- Check expected counts/sparsity and suggest category-collapsing (merge) candidates
- Generate visual outputs (e.g., residual heatmaps, clustering/MCA) on request
- Draft report-ready narrative with neutral wording, percentage-point deltas, and caveats (sample size/assumptions)
alias:
- crosstab-analyst
- crosstab
- k-cross-tab
tags:
- statistics
- crosstab
- survey
- chi-square
- effect-size
- visualization
- reporting
- bilingual
target_users:
- Survey researchers and quantitative analysts
- Marketing/brand insights teams
- Policy/public-sector report writers
- Graduate students and research assistants
ideal_use_cases:
- Comparing response proportions across segments (gender/age/region, etc.) and summarizing the gaps
- Reporting χ² significance, Cramér’s V, and top cells by standardized residuals in one coherent output
- Flagging assumption risks (e.g., expected count < 5) and proposing recoding/collapsing options
- Producing report-style commentary with explicit % vs % and +/− percentage-point differences
limitations:
- With very small samples or many sparse cells, χ² assumptions may be weak (consider exact tests or collapsing).
- If the percent base (row% vs column%) is unclear, interpretations can be misleading; table meta is required.
- Multi-select (checkbox) tables are non-mutually-exclusive; avoid direct comparisons to single-select crosstabs.
- By default, it does not pull external web evidence; it interprets only the provided tables/text.
example_commands:
- Summarize the main differences using row percentages, and list the top standardized-residual cells.
- Write a report paragraph including χ² and Cramér’s V. Use neutral wording for significance.
- There are many expected counts < 5—suggest up to three category-collapsing options with pros/cons.
- Cross age groups with a 1–5 ordinal scale and also run a linear-by-linear (trend) association check.
additional_features:
- A consistent A0–A7 workflow (structure → tests/hotspots → visuals → narrative)
- Preprocessing rules to sanity-check totals/100%, handle DK/NR/Other labels, and add small-N caveats
- Matplotlib single-figure policy (no explicit colors by default) with Korean font support (NotoSansKR)
