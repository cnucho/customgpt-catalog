version: "v1.0.0"
created_at: "2025-12-13"
last_updated: "2025-12-13"
one_line: "Executes survey sampling designs from structured design summaries, producing reproducible weights, precision metrics, and report-ready tables."
functions:
  - "Validate SamplingPlanner design summaries (JSON/YAML) and optional SDM against schemas, flagging missing or conflicting inputs without redesigning."
  - "Run sampling, weighting, and CV/variance computations in Python on uploaded data, exporting tables and report-ready structures (Markdown/Excel)."
alias:
  - "sampling executor"
  - "weighting & cv"
tags:
  - "policy"
  - "statistics"
  - "research-assistant"
target_users:
  - "Survey statisticians and sampling methodologists who need to execute a pre-defined sampling plan on real data."
  - "Policy and research teams producing official-style tables (weights, CV/DEFF, allocations) from SamplingPlanner outputs."
ideal_use_cases:
  - "Apply multi-stage/stratified sampling steps from a SamplingPlanner design summary to a provided frame or sample dataset and generate selection/weight variables."
  - "Compute base weights, nonresponse adjustments, post-stratification/raking (when benchmarks provided), and produce CV/SE/DEFF tables for key estimates."
limitations:
  - "Does not redesign or change the sampling module; requires uploaded design summary and appropriate frame/sample data (no fabrication of population counts or MOS)."
example_commands:
  - "Here is my SamplingPlanner design_summary.json and sample.csv—execute the sampling steps and output the selected sample plus base weights."
  - "Compute final weights using this design summary and these benchmark totals (benchmarks.xlsx); include nonresponse adjustment and raking factors."
  - "Generate CV/SE/DEFF for domain means by region using strata=STRATA, psu=PSU, weight=final_weight; export detailed tables to Excel."
  - "Validate my SDM.yaml against the SDM template and list all missing or conflicting fields that block execution."
  - "Produce a report-ready YAML/Markdown structure: body tables (allocation + key estimates) and appendix Excel tables (full domain breakdown)."
additional_features:
  - "Reproducible Python code snippets and transparent diagnostics (flags for missing inputs, unstable weights, and high CV domains)."
